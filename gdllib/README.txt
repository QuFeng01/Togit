Here is a doubly linked list demo code.
Which include four parts:
Makefile tells the working procedure of the project.
gdllib.h includes the member of the project, which include the varibles structures and functions.
gdllib.c gives the achievements of member that gddlib.h has.
demo.c is the test code to make sure the doubly linked list code is working normal.
While use command "make", there will create the binary "dllib".
When use command "make clean", all things that created by "make" will be deleted.
