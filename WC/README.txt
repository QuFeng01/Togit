Here is a character counting program.
There is a doubly linked list library named "libdoull.a" and 3 test files which "paper.txt" "file.txt" and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.txt" to help archieve character counting. except that, there also a Makefile to manage the projects.
Code files are gdllib.h gdllib.c wordcount.h wordcount.c and main.c.
gdllib.h and gdllib.c is the source code of doubly linked list library "libdoull.a".
wordcount.h and wordcount.c archieve the wordcount function.
main.c is the test file or a demo of character counting project.
